# Html Serializer

## 🌐 Overview

**Html Serializer** is a lightweight and efficient tool written in **C#** for:

- 🔄 **Parsing raw HTML** from web pages
- 🌳 **Converting the HTML** into a structured C# object tree (DOM-like)
- 🔍 **Querying the tree** using **CSS-like selectors**, enabling fast and intuitive access to elements

This is ideal for scraping, analyzing, or transforming HTML content in .NET applications.
